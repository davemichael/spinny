# spinny
A relaxing puzzle game, like popping bubble wrap on the web. And a chance for me to play around with Web tech again, like three.js.

Click to spin right, double-click to spin left, Ctrl-click or meta-click to lock a ball in place. Make all adjacent colors match up.

You can try it out at http://calming.games
